He won the Hong Kong cha-cha championship back in 1958 in fact.\\n I always just thought of him as a martial arts legend.  Now he is a dance legend of sorts too!\\n Yeah!! That is correct. He was a fantastic martial artist. Did you know that Tupac danced ballet in high school?\\n  Yeah!  He was the mouse king in the Nutcracker.  Thats pretty cool, I would definitely never have guessed that about him.\\n Neither did I. That is insane because Tupac was a famous rapper.\\n  He was indeed, his music is even in the library of congress.\\n I didn't know this thanks for sharing.\\n Sure thing!  Did you hear about Michael Jackson's special patent shoes?\\n No. I know that Michael Jackson was a fantastic dancer but can you tell me more about his patent shoes if you don't mind.\\n There was a specific device in his shoes that helped with his extreme lean in some dance moves.\\n Wow!!! That is amazing coming from such a talented singer and dancer. I couldn't even dance like that even if I dreamed of it.\\n Me neither. I could never be a professional dancer.\\n I heard that some professional ballet dancer can go through four pairs of shoes in a week.\\n That is crazy!  That can't be cheap for them.\\n No. I think its very expensive for them to be professional ballet dancers based on this.\\n  It has been great chatting but I must go!  Gotta go get my Bruce Lee on, the martial arts part...  definitely not the dance.\\n Ha Ha!!! It was so nice chatting with you as well!! Have a nice day!!! Bye\\n Bye\"}\n"
